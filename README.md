# Lab 1.4 - Operators and Printing

Complete the following programming assignments
* You should declare variables with appropriate names.
* Ask the user for input in order to get your variable values.
* Input / Output should be exactly the same as shown.

## 1.4.1: Convert Time

Complete a method to convert a time (in minutes) to hours and the remaining minutes. Prompt the user for the number of minutes. 

Your output should look like this:
```
Enter the number of minutes :: 625
625 is 10 hours and 25 minutes
```

## Lab 1.4.2: Momentum
An object’s momentum is its mass multiplied by its velocity. Write a program that prompts the user for an object’s mass in kilograms and velocity (in meters per second) as inputs and prints its momentum. 

Your output should look like this:
```
Enter the mass :: 10 
Enter the velocity :: 5
Momentum == 50
```

## Lab 1.4.3: Kinetic Energy
The kinetic energy of a moving object is given by the formula KE = ½ mv2, where m is the object’s mass and v is its velocity. Write a program that prompts for mass and velocity and prints kinetic energy. You do not want a floating point value as your answer. 

Your output should look like this:
```
Enter the mass :: 10
Enter the velocity :: 5
Kinetic energy == 125
```

## Lab 1.4.4: Calculate Paycheck
An employee’s total work pay equals the hourly wage multiplied by the total number of regular hours plus any overtime pay. Overtime pay equals the total overtime hours multiplied by 1.5 times the hourly wage. Write a method that takes as parameters the hourly wage, total regular hours, and total overtime hours and displays an employee’s total weekly pay. 

Your output should look like this, but don't worry about the decimal places, and you get the $ by printing it:
```
Enter the number of hours :: 40
Enter the hours of overtime :: 4
Enter the hourly wage :: 12.5
40 hours plus 4 overtime at $12.5 is $575.0
```
# Lab 1.4.5: Coin Total
Write a program that prompts the user for the number of each type of coin and prints the total value. The program should ask for four inputs: quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies (in that order). 

Your output should look like this:
```
Enter the number of quarters :: 10
Enter the number of dimes :: 5
Enter the number of nickels :: 4
Enter the number of pennies :: 3
10q's, 5d's, 4n's, and 3p's is 323 cents
```

# Lab 1.4.6: Dooflingies:
The shipping clerk at the Rinky Dooflingy Company is faced with the following problem:  Dooflingies are very delicate and must be shipped in special containers.  These containers are available in four sizes:  huge, large, medium, and small, which can hold 50, 20, 5, and 1 dooflingy, respectively.  Your program should allow a user to input any total number of dooflingies to be shipped and then display the number of huge, large, medium, and small containers needed to send the shipment in the minimum number of containers, and with the minimum amount of wasted space.  

The output should look like this:
```
Enter the number of Dooflingies :: 1098
Container    Number
Huge         21
Large        2
Medium       1
Small        3
```
